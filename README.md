# The Ultimate Spring Boot Course

This repository contains the source code for my Spring Boot course: 

https://codewithmosh.com/p/spring-boot-fundamentals

Each commit in this repository is named after the corresponding lesson, so you can easily track changes and see exactly what code was written in each step of the course. This allows you to follow along lesson by lesson and compare your code with mine.

Additionally, Iâ€™ve added tags at the beginning of each major section. This makes it easy to jump to a specific section and start coding from there.

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/spring-store

cd spring-store
```

I've added tags at the beginning of each section. If you want to start from a particular seciton, you can check out the corresponding tag.

```sh
git checkout part1-section3-start
```
